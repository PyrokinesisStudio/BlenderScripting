Please start with the standard scene and open a python console (01_OpenPythonConsole.jpg).

Which objects do I have?

>>> list(bpy.data.objects)
[bpy.data.objects['Camera'], bpy.data.objects['Cube'], bpy.data.objects['Lamp']]

I want to delete my camera.

>>> import bpy
>>> bpy.data.objects['Camera'].select = True
>>> bpy.ops.object.delete()
{'FINISHED'}

#Where is my cube gone?

>>> list(bpy.data.objects)
[bpy.data.objects['Lamp']]

If the cube is selected (standard scene) it will also be deleted. So we should deselect all objects first!

>>> import bpy
>>> bpy.ops.object.select_all(action='DESELECT')
>>> bpy.data.objects['Camera'].select = True
>>> bpy.ops.object.delete()
{'FINISHED'}
