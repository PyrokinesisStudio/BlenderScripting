Okay, now it's time to write a .py file and execute it.
Because we like to see the output, it is necessary to install the "console_run_script.py" add-on.

1.) Copy the code section to a new file and save it as "console_run_script.py"

2.) Open blender => File => User Preferences... => Add-ons => Install from File... => "console_run_script.py" => Enable / Check it => Save User Settings

3.) Change to the Python Console and check if there is a menu item called "Run script"

4.) Change to the Text Editor and click at the Syntax highlight ("ab")

5.) Write and Save your scripts in this view and run them in the Python Console

6.) E.g. write this program and save it as 07_LoadScript_01.py

import bpy
print("Blender is alive!!!")

7.) Python Console => Console => "Run script" => 07_LoadScript_01.py

>>> exec(compile(bpy.data.texts['07_LoadScript_01.py'].as_string(), '07_LoadScript_01.py', 'exec'))
Blender is alive!!!
